            <h2>The Last of Us Part II</h2> <p>Ah, yes. The game with a story so good
            that I’ll never—and I mean, never—play it again. The Last of Us
            Part II hit right in the first few months of the pandemic, which
            meant all of us were already in a not-so-stable mood when we first
            got a chance to catch up with Ellie and Joel again. As a follow-up
            to the famous first title from Naughty Dog, it was daunting,
            reckless, and unexpected. (I won’t spoil anything here, but you
            can check out my review if you’d like to relive some of the
            trauma.) It defied a lot of what made the previous title so good,
            and caused a bit of a riptide in the gaming community. But,
            although it may have isolated some fans who were hoping for more
            of the same, Naughty Dog deserves a lot of credit for having the
            courage to spend some time looking in the mirror and reassessing
            the modern action-adventure genre that the studio itself helped
            create. They wrote a story so challenging, so tortured, that it
            left many of us flat on our backs, afraid to ever press start
            again.</p>

             <h2>Final Fantasy VII Remake</h2><p>This year we finally got to return to Midgar, and it was glorious. 
               Sure, any game surrounded by this much hype was bound to have criticism heaped on it, but Final Fantasy VII Remake is a masterful reimagining of the title that redefined what an RPG could be. 
               It takes the iconic story of the original and draws it out, but not in a shallow way. Tetsuya Nomura and Square Enix fleshed out nearly everything in this world that could be fleshed out—like so many characters who appeared in FF7 but never got the time of day, save for roles as class fillers in the party—without making it drag. 
               Remake also introduced an engaging style of action-RPG, melding the party balancing system from traditional RPGs with more fluid, flashy combat, and overturning the turned-based system. It was revelatory as a longtime fan to dive back in and experience so much more of Midgar, all while digesting it in the way the original illustrators wanted our imaginations to see those primitive, 
               blocky 3D characters more than 20 years ago. </p>

          <div class="paragrafpg1"><h2>Ghost of Tsushima</h2><p>Ghost of Tsushima wasn't on my radar nearly as much as it should have been before its launch (my bad), and now it's all I can play. This game demonstrates precise action-RPG combat, 
            where timely dodges and blocking are crucial, then blends it with so many different (and challenging) playstyles. Are you going to be Jin, sticking to the samurai code and facing your enemies head-on, crowd-controlling larger groups? Or are you going to work like a ghost, emphasizing stealth? 
            The best part is you can, and should, do both. These extremely polished combat styles are mixed with a metric ton of tools and abilities, and now that there’s online multiplayer, which is out of this world (especially for a free update), it's amazing to see just how differently everyone plays this game—and how any strategy, 
            after being refined, seems to work.
             A title with a combat system so deep that it can support never-ending options for tackling any given obstacle deserves a massive amount of respect. Beyond all of that, it's just a damn fun, and damn beautiful, game. </p>
